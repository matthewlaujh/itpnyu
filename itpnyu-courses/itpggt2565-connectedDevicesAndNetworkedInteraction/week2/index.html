      <h6>
        Create an HTML file including at least 4 different element types and at
        least 10 elements total. At least one element should be an input
        element. Create a stylesheet and link it to your webpage to style your
        elements. Create a JS script for your page, either inside a script tag
        or in a separate .js file, containing 3 different event listeners, all
        of which should manipulate the appearance of your webpage by changing
        some attribute of an element on the page: One of the event listeners
        should be attached to your input element and do something with the
        inputted value. One of the event listeners should be attached to the
        window and respond to a mouse event (click, drag, move, etc.) or the
        keyboard
