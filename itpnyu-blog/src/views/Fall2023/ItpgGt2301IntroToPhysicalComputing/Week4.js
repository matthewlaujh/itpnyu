          Working with{" "}
          <Links to="https://www.itp.jnackash.com/">Jasmine Nackash</Links> for
          this Mid-Term project. We met to come up with a concept and some ideas
          and landed on this spider web visual inspired ouija board-esque
          interactive piece using stretch sensors and electromagnets. The idea
          is that we would create this string movement instrument-ish object
          that would control the sounds being played based on where the strings
          moved to (using the electromagnets) and the sound frequency/volume
          would be manipulated by the tension/resistance of the strings.

          A microcontroller â€” Probably an Arduino NANO 33 IOT or an Arduino UNO
          <br></br>
          Conductive Rubber Cord (two or three)<br></br>
          Electro magnets. (8-12))<br></br>
          Speakers (two or three)<br></br>
          Wooden board (around 12" rectangular board we'll probably cut into a
          circle).<br></br>

        <Subheader>Questions for class.</Subheader>
        <Text>
          Do electromagnets offset the resistance of conductive string? If so,
          how might we address that?<br></br>
          Can we make our own electromagnets?<br></br>
          Can we make our own speakers? Can we perhaps turn this whole thing
          into a speaker?!<br></br>
          Can we somehow paint the conductive strings?<br></br>
          How unpredictable could electromagnets be? Do they have a range in
          which they operate? Are they stable enough for our purpose?<br></br>
