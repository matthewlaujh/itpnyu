          Progressing forward with our concept, I came to this realization while
          working on it, initially it was very positive like this would be good
          for cinema and it's a plausible speculative future but while working
          on the clips I realised, this is actually quite dark. Like
          realistically how much can you change before things break? What's the
          limit if there even is one? Should there be one? Where does it end?
          What’s the relevance of the artist’s intention if you can customize
          everything? What are the limits of language** when describing style?
          How much can you modify something until it bear no resemblance the
          original? That's when the concept of the video changed slightly, or
          atleast our ending. Narratively wise it's a build up, it starts with
          the user being super specific, then they get wishy washy and change
          things on a whim, and then they just go with whatever and wants to do
          something that doesn't even make sense anf changes the film
          fundamentally. That's sort of the flow we created to showcase the
          narrative of the questions we posted when thinking critically about
          the concept.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          We decided to have the ending go insane cause the user has changed so
          much, the user hasn't been specific with the changes so the AI just
          messes up the whole movie, "glitching out", loosing all meaning and
          even loosing all visual sense.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          With that in mind I proceeded to cut up the clips and preparing
          everything similar to how I did it last week for my part, but decided
          to do more AI-generated footage and try to let Runway go as crazy as
          it could with it (within reason), didn't have much credits left so I
          played it safe with the demo styles that we could do style transfer
          with. But I still did a bunch for all scenarios like the whole clip,
          characters removed, background with characters. Octavio then took over
          and went crazy with the glitches and even did the sound design for the
          project, I think the sound really made the project a lot more
          convincing and brought so much value to the video. Thanks Octavio for
          that :)
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          We realised we needed an opening scene, and that got me thinking about
          how could a future TV look like and what would the interface be. I
          decided to use this lamp I had at home and imagined that as a TV. I
          filmed it turning on and for a few seconds then I played with the
          brightness and white balance in editing to give it some life. It
          starts from a slow pulse showing that it's in standby mode, just
          waiting for instructions, then when we voice activate it, it pulses
          quick to show that it got the instructions, and then there's a change
          of state where it goes dark and starts up in a different mode. I
          thought this was a nice exercise in just thinking about how to simply
          show these interactions and changes in states through light, cause a
          TV is kind of like a light source, and so maybe a futuristic tv could
          be both, but it also can't be too invasive and disrupt the home, so
          what's the right balance here. A slow pulse made sense to me, as it
          reminded me of mood lamps that people would have in their homes, and
          it's not too invasive, but it's also not too subtle that you wouldn't
          notice it.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>I think this project was a good start at least for me, in
          looking at ways to while retaining my knowledge and skills in more
          traditional softwares but also finding ways to integrate AI into my
          workflows. And I think it's in a good place of balance between the
          tools. Conceptually also, I think I progressed in taking a simple
          novel idea, but also thinking critically about it to give it extra
          depth and dimension making it a much stronger concept by the end.
