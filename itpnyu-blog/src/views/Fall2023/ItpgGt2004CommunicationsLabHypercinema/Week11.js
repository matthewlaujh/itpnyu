          We've just been having lots of thoughts around the idea of trapping
          sound but nothing seems to have stuck so far. We keep having second
          thoughts about the ideas due to the complexity of some of them and
          conceptually we weren't satisfied, the ideas so far have felt too
          straightforward and literal and we are more interest in pushing the
          concept further rather than just make something pretty and simple.

          Taking a break from thinking about this project over thanksgiving, we
          have some ideas but we're gonna let them stew for a bit and see if we
          like it when we come back to it.

          This week's in-class tutorials were great to learn more about the
          visuals in unity, creating the material textures and triggering
          different animations/playback. This is where I can see things getting
          complicated but also very interesting. Especially being able to play
          with different textures and linking different component triggers. Also
          I don't usually think in 3D, but starting to "world build" in 3D and
          just to navigate through 3D needs some getting used to but should be
          something manageable.
